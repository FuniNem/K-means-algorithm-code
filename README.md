# K-means-algorithm-code
This file contains a basic k-means algorithm  code for clustering data. The code was coded from scratch using no python libraries.
The code is a simple version of the k-means algorithm which assumes k= 3 clusters but can be modified for more complex datasets which maay contain more clusters.
